Unpack the source tarball and run make in the resulting dir.
You need FUSE and libxml2 (most distros come with them installed),
libzip and libapp.

Usage
=====

Usage: boxfs [options] [mountPoint] [FUSE Mount Options]

Options:
  -H                show optional FUSE mount options
  -u login          box.net login name
  -p password       box.net password
  -f conffile       file containing configuration options
  -v                turn on verbose syslogging
  -l                turn on support for large files (splitting)
  -s                turn on secure connections (HTTPS) to box.net

Configuration file example:
username   = mymail@mydomain.com
mountpoint = /path/to/folder
verbose    = no
secure     = no
password = secret
largefiles = yes

Lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.

If username and/or password are not specified in the command line or in configuration file,
boxfs will prompt for them at run time.
The mountpoint must be provided, after the other options or in the configuration file.

When you've done using your files, unmount your filsystem
with fusermount -u mountpoint
